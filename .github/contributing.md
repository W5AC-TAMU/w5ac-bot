# Welcome to the W5AC Bot Contributing Guide

I'm gonna be honest. This is an amateur radio bot. We're not super strict here. I just have a few requests:

- Please keep your code readable. Try to follow the style in our existing files.
- Changes should be tied to an issue. You should open a feature request/bug fix before creating a pull request to impliment it.
